# Portal ðŸ”µðŸŸ 

This is a project made as a prototype/proof of concept to replicate the portal mechanic from Portal using Unity and URP

There are three scenes: 
 - One with static portals
 - Other with recursive (and fixed) portals
 - And one with portal placement such as you would do in the game with the Portal Gun 


Other branches are there as I tried different approaches to rendering the portal view.
